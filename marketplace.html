          A rare hybrid marijuana strain that is primarily
          found in Canada. OG Shark is beloved for its
          high potency, earthy aroma and therapeutic
          qualities. The effects of this strain 
          are sedating and relaxing. Medical marijuana patients 
          choose OG Shark to relieve symptoms associated 
          with nausea, pain and insomnia. Growers say this 
          strain grows best in a dry, outdoor climate.

          A slightly sativa-dominant hybrid that provides
          a clear-headed, cerebral high coupled with a strong
          energetic indica buzz at the same time. The high
          experienced from the strain is euphoric and
          energetic, on a level that goes beyond what
          most sativas are capable of.

          A famous sativa strain from the Montreal Compassion
          Club and was the first ever cannabis strain to be
          featured in the New York times. The Jean Guy is a
          sativa dominant cross. It grows quickly, producing
          thick lateral branches and heavy colas. It is a
          finicky plant best suited to advanced growers.

          Chunky and somewhat conical and tapered. The bud
          structure of the flowers are more sativa than indica,
          with a loose and fluffy texture that can be broken
          up somewhat easily despite its stickiness. The leaves
          are spring green with few visible pistils.

          As coveted as its OG Kush relative, is an indica-dominant
          hybrid with powerful body-focused effects. In its exceptional
          variations, pink hairs burst from bright green buds barely
          visible under a blanket of sugar-like trichomes, with traces
          of a sweet vanilla and candy perfume.

          A quite big and chunky. It's definitely a strong yielder.
          The quality of the buds is very high as well. They have
          the appearance of a big hybrid plant but with the density
          of an Indica.

          that emits a sweet citrus odor with skunky undertones.
          It produces round, deep green buds with burnt yellow pistils

          Is another hybrid strain of weed that is slightly
          sativa-dominant. It gives an energetic cerebral high
          that can increase motivation and heighten focus. Some
          people describe it as having relaxing and pain-relieving
          effects. Its name comes from the fact that the origin
          of the strain is unknown, making it like a dream.
